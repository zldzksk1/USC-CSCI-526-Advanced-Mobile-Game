This repository serves as a platform for sharing my completed team project called Spider-Math from the Advanced mobile game at the University of Southern California.

Our team implemented Spiderman-inspired themed platformer where the player swings around on spheres to traverse the level. 
You are able to grab math collectables to defeat enemies while improving your math skills in the process. As you go, the levels get more and more complex, with different obstacles and challenges in your way.
* I modified the game object design
